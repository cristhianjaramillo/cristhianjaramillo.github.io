This repository houses my thesis titled "Unravelling Party Discipline in the Global South: A Case Study of Peru Using Beta Regression Analysis," part of the MSc Social Research Methods program at the London School of Economics and Political Science. It explores party control's correlation with party discipline in Peru (2011-2019) through a party discipline index constructed from MPs' voting behaviors.

**Contents:**

-   Research Overview: Discusses the research question, methodology, and hypotheses.
-   Citation Information: Provides citation details for the dataset and citation styles.
-   Raw Data: Original data in PDFs documenting voting behavior across specific motions.
-   Final Data: Comprehensive datasets detailing MPs' voting behaviors and party discipline indices for analysis.
-   Code: Scripts to replicate analytical figures from the thesis and figures generated by these scripts.

The thesis delves into party control's impact on party discipline, examining voting behaviors of Peruvian MPs in significant motions. It includes raw and finalized data, analysis code, and model evaluation to replicate and understand the study's findings regarding party discipline in Peru's political landscape from 2011 to 2019.
