If you're an academic, you need a website. Obviously I agree with this since you're reading this on my website, but if you don't have one, you should get one. Most universities these days provide a free option, usually powered by [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) (both [WashU](https://sites.wustl.edu/) and [UNC](http://web.unc.edu/) use WordPress for their respective offerings). While these sites are quick to set up and come with the prestige of a `.edu` URL, they have several drawbacks that have been [extensively](https://townsendcenter.berkeley.edu/blog/personal-academic-webpages-how-tos-and-tips-better-site) [written](https://martinlea.com/four-reasons-why-faculty-profile-pages-are-no-substitute-for-personal-academic-website/) [on](https://theacademicdesigner.com/2019/personal-academic-website-benefits/).

If you're a junior scholar, having your own personal webpage is even more important:
- If (when) you move institutions, you'll lose your website
- Even if you can export the contents of a WordPress site, there's no guarantee it will seamlessly integrate with another university's implementation
- Even worse, you'll lose your search engine ranking since you'll be starting over from square one with a new URL

Even if you stay at the same institution for the rest of your career, you're at the mercy of IT and your site may be taken down by a change to the hosting platform at some point in the future.

# My approach

There are plenty of guides out there on how to create a personal website using tools like WordPress, [Wix](https://www.wix.com), or [Google Sites](https://www.sites.google.com/). The free versions of these tools often come with ads, or at the least a message telling you which tool was used to create the website. I take a different approach that requires some (minimal) coding experience, but produces a beautiful and professional website that is ad free. I use a [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/about) that produces HTML from easy to edit [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files. Because the resulting site is static (it's just a collection of files with no interactivity where users can .e.g, fill out and submit forms) it can be hosted for free with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). [Steven Miller](http://svmiller.com) has a nice rundown on all of the [advantages](http://svmiller.com/blog/2015/08/create-your-website-in-jekyll/#advantages) of this approach.

## Who this guide is for

This guide is intended for someone with a basic level of coding experience and comfort with Markdown files. Anyone who's received graduate training in quantitative social science in the past few years should have all the necessary skills. I'm assuming some familiarity with using the [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator), but no experience with Git or GitHub is needed.

There are other guides to using static site generators to make academic websites, but they all assume a very high level of experience with the required tools and the ability to conduct extensive troubleshooting on your own. The template I use contains a 6 point checklist with no illustrations or examples. I've written this guide for people who have some experience coding, but don't want to spend an afternoon learning two new languages on their own. If you know how to use R Markdown you have all the skills you need to build a website.

## Conventions

In this tutorial, I use a couple of conventions to describe computer code and the actions you'll do with it. Anytime you see content between two angle brackets, you should replace the content with the appropriate version for yourself. For example, \<yourusername\> would become jayrobwilliams for me, because that is my GitHub username. You'll also frequently see 

```
highlighted code blocks like this
```

with this icon <i class="fa fa-code" aria-hidden="true"></i> in the top right corner. These can denote either code you should enter and run, or the output of running a command. I will clearly state which of these options applies in any given case. Sometimes you will also see `inline code` like this, and again I'll note whether these represent code you should run, or the output of code.

> A brief aside on Git-speak: these periodic indented blocks will explain the terminology that Git uses to help you understand what each Git command actually does.

# Getting started

Two of the most popular programs available for building static sites from Markdown files are [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Relevant for us is that each one has a full-featured theme for academic websites that you've probably seen before. There are plenty of differences under the hood, but the most important one for building an academic website is that Hugo integrates nicely with the [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) R package, letting you write your website entirely in R. I chose Jekyll over Hugo because I liked the [Jekyll theme](https://academicpages.github.io/) better than the [Hugo one](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/). My life might have been easier if I'd gone with Hugo and `blogdown`, but here we are. Consequently, this tutorial will show you how to set up an academic website using Jekyll.

## GitHub

The first thing you need to do is create a GitHub account if you don't already have one. If you do have one, great! If you don't already have an account, think about your username carefully. Unless you set up a custom domain name (which we'll cover in a separate post), your website's URL will be \<yourusername\>.github.io. Setting up a custom domain name is a little trick and isn't free, so pick a username that works as a URL as well.

> Git-speak aside: the basic unit of GitHub is the *repository*. Repositories are just folders (directories, if you want to be pedantic), but Git keeps a record of the files in the folders. We'll start by making a repository on GitHub and then later download that repository to our computer. In both cases, it's just a folder. The magic of Git is that we can link the two so that changes you make in your local repository (the one on your computer) will sync with the remote repository (the one on GitHub). When people (myself included) get lazy, they'll often shorten repository to 'repo'.

Once you've logged into GitHub, the next step is to head over to the [repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) for the template we'll be using. We need to copy the template so we can get our own version that we can mess around with. In GitHub parlance we need to *fork* the template repository to get our own copy. Find the Fork button at the top right of the template repository (highlighted in green below), and click it.[^1]

After a brief wait (and an amusing GIF), you'll land at your forked copy of the repo. If you look closely, you'll notice that the name in the top left has changed. Where it originally said "academicpages/academicpages.github.io" it should now read "\<yourusername\>/academicpages.github.io". As you can see below, for me this is now "jayrobwilliams/academicpages.github.io". We need to change this! Not just so people know that this is your website, but to get it online. Click the Settings button with the <i class="fa fa-fw fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon (highlighted in green below).

![](/images/posts/creating-website/settings.png)

This will, unsurprisingly, take you to the Settings page. The very first option (highlighted in green below) is the repository name, and that's all we need to worry about now. It should look like this, with \<yourusername\> in place of jayrobwilliams before the .github.io. Now, we need to change the repository name to \<yourusername\>.github.io. It's important that the first part of the repo name *exactly* match your GitHub username, or you'll run into trouble later when putting your website online.

In my case, I renamed the repo to "jayrobwilliams.github.io" because my GitHub username is jayrobwilliams.

We've told GitHub that this repository is for our website, so now it's time to start working on that website. To do that, we need to get the files for our website into our computer.

## Git

Since we're going to host our website on GitHub, you'll need to make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. Git is a version control system designed to let teams of programmers collaborate on projects seamlessly. For us, it's just going to be the way that we upload files for our webpage to GitHub. You can download Git from the [official downloads page](https://git-scm.com/downloads), but there are a couple of easier ways. If you're on MacOS, you can install Git via the Xcode Command Line Tools by running

```bash
xcode-select --install
```
