üîç Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the Care Policy and Evaluation Centre, LSE, and Researcher at the [Observatorio de Reformas Pol√≠ticas en Am√©rica Latina](https://www.reformaspol√≠ticas.org). My research focus on political parties, electoral reforms, and elections in Latin America. 

üìö I have also been involved directing academic journals in Latin America such as [Elecciones](https://revistas.onpe.gob.pe/index.php/elecciones) and [Politai](https://revistas.pucp.edu.pe/index.php/politai), contributing to their visibility in academic circles.

üìä My interests extend to quantitative studies, coding, data visualization using R, and my teaching experience encompasses Statistics for Political Analysis at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru and other institutions.

‚ú® Beyond my academic work, I hold a profound fascination for art, particularly paintings stemming from the Impressionist movement. I frequently curate and share artworks that catch my attention on my [Art Blog](https://artchronicles.tumblr.com/). ‚ôüÔ∏èAdditionally, while I do not compete at a professional level, I find immense joy in playing chess and am an enthusiastic spectator of the game.
